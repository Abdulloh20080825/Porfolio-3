export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a Full Stack developer, and I started learning programming in April 2023. In February 2024, I learned HTML, CSS, and advanced JavaScript. After that, I started learning a JavaScript library called React JS and reached an advanced level by April 2024. My first project using React JS was a React calculator. I then movedon to developing a React-based Pokemon application and various other
projects. In June 2024, I decided to expand my skills and started learning Python. However, I faced some difficulties and decided to shift my focus to learning Node.js and Express.js instead.In just 2 weeks, I was able to learn these frameworks and start building full-stack projects. This experience has shown me the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies.I'm passionate about programming and enjoy the challenge ofmastering new frameworks and tools to create innovative solutions.`;
